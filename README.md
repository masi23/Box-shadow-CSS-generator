# Box-shadow-CSS-generator
Helpful tool inspired by already existing ones. 
It lets you generate needed piece of CSS code responsible for styling box shadow by manipulating toggle and color inputs. 
Project created by using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript library jQuery.
Contains few simple animations. 
If you find this project somehow helpful, feel free to use it as you wish. At last it's not that much of a code :)
Responsive design's included but this tool is not meant for mobile use. That's why I provided only simplest vertical orientation layout, that won't crush on mobiles.
